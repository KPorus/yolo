# Welcome to YOLO ðŸ‘‹

This project focuses on two main features: designing the navigation bar and implementing a freezing effect to hide the user card.

I have created four components:

- **Tab Bar Curve**: Separates the tab bar curve design for a cleaner coding experience.
- **Buttons**: A reusable component to handle button designs.
- **Card**: Includes the card design along with freeze and unfreeze actions, split into different sub-files for better organization.
- **Dummy**: A helper for managing data, using Faker API to generate dummy content.

Additionally, I have used **Yarn** for package management and **TypeScript** for type checking.
